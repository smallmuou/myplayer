# myplayer

myplayer is my family customized music player. with raspberrypi + dac + volumio + motion + myplayer + cron, i build a self-play music player. it has follow feature:

1. when some one at home, it will auto play. 
2. when some one leave home, it will auto pause.
3. it will play wakeup songs in the early morning.
4. it will play storys at the night.

although, it is very cool. but there are a lot of things need to improve. as follow:

1. can not auto generate playlist
2. can not adjust schedule through phone.


## install

```bash
sudo ./install
```
